Compiling
=========

$ make

The stackdump.c is optional, it is only included to aid in debugging and sharing bug reports.

Running the tests
=================

$ make tests

You will need to have q3vm utilities from Quake3 to build the tests. You can
build them in the ioquake3 source and copy the binaries q3asm and q3lcc
into tools/ directory.
